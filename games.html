            <p> This is a 2D game I created with classmates in a 48 hour game jam.
                We used Unity 2D, C# and Github Version Control to create the game. 
                I was primarily responsible for the button mechanics, sound effects, and the stuffed toys.

            <p> This is a 2D game I created with classmates in my game development class.
                We used Unity 2D, C#, and Github Version Control to create the game. 
                I was primarily responsible for the design of the frog, where I used Photoshop to 
                create the frog sprite sheet and coded the frog mechanics. I also worked on the scene management and timer,
                the sound effects on Audacity, and some UI scenes.
